    <h1> Frequently Asked Questions </h1>

    <h3> What age ranges is Party Paradise appropriate for? </h3>
    <p> We would recommend only parties involving people below 20 years old; we do teenage parties too for example
        paintball parties or horror parties.
    <p> As well as younger children's parties like Disney princess parties or race car parties.
    <h3> What is the maximum and minimum number of people at your parties? </h3>
    <p> We do parties for any number of people, be it 1000 people for the incredibly extroverted child or be it one for
        that incredibly lonely kid. </h3>
    <h3> What if a child does not like the party you throw them? </h3>
    <p> Then he or she will be shot. Sorry, just my Wei-ish sense of humour. The party will be totally refunded.
    <h3> What if either the child whom your party is being thrown for or one of the guests injure themselves at a party
        of yours? </h3>
    <p> As your children are our top priority, in this disastrous scenario, the party will have to be put on hold while
        the catastrophe is sorted out.
    <h3> Related question: What if someone at the party injurs you? </h3>
    <p> I don't think any child will be able to injure me.
