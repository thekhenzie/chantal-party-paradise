    <h1> Party Paradise </h1>
    <h3> Our Mission </h3>
    <p> Party Paradise was set up in 2022 by two university friends: Wei Zhang and Moana Belich. They assist parents
        with party planning (generally for younger children), organisation of venues, catering, and any other
        requirements for your parties. </p>
    <p> Weiâ€™s area of expertise is the entertainment and catering for your party, so it can be trusted that entertainers
        for your party will be professional, and that the food at your party will be tasty and free from any allergens
        as recommended by the host. </p>
    <p> Moana was an economist, so she will organise the venue planning, making sure that your venue is within a certain
        target area, and that all of the activities planned by Wei will fit within any budget, so the hosts can plan the
        party of their dreams without going over budget. </p>
    <p> Party Paradise will take as much care as possible in making your party the best it possibly can be! </p>
